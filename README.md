### Deploying on generic systems
For deploying Unifi Network Application on a **generic system**, I suggest to follow instructions for DietPi systems and just change the volume bindings and resource allocation to the appropriate ones for your system.

### For CasaOS users, help needed:
I created a [Pull Request](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppStore/pull/374) to add this implementation of Unifi Network Application to the official AppStore. If you can, consider testing it and sharing your experience there.
