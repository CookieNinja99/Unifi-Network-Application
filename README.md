### Common issue
Sometimes the unifi-network-application will start before the db is ready, this stops the starting process.
To solve this, just restart the network application container.

### For CasaOS users, help needed:
I created a [Pull Request](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppStore/pull/374) to add this implementation of Unifi Network Application to the official AppStore. If you can, consider testing it and sharing your experience there.
